## Useful scripts

- `start`: Serve the app with hot reload enabled. Useful for development.
- `build`: Creates a production-ready build.
- `open:[ios/android]`: Opens the native project in its corresponding IDE (Android Studio/Xcode).
- `build:sync`: Same as build, but also syncs the built files with the native projects.
